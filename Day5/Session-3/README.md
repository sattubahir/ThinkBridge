# JavaScript Functions, Scope, and Objects Practice

## Overview

This repository contains practice exercises on JavaScript fundamentals focusing on:

- Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions  
- Variable scope (block scope with let/const, function scope with var)  
- Object creation, property access, and iteration  
- Advanced function concepts like closures, rest parameters, and immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE)  

These exercises are designed to reinforce core JavaScript programming concepts through simple examples.
